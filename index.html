          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel got
          very penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years befor I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly threafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and the most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the curse, I've successfully swithced careers, working as a
          Software Engineerat a VR startup."

          "Befor joing the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed
          some structure from professioinals who can help me learn programming
          step by ste. I was encourged to enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can oly say wonderful thins about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff is not disappint. They were very hands-on and I
          never had to wait long to assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. I took my learning to the next level in a
          way that no turial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
          during interviews as an example of my development experience. It
          certainly helped me land a job as a full-stak developer after
          receiving offers. 100% recommend!"
